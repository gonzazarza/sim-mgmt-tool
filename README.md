Overview

The Simulation Management Tool allows users to efficiently launch parametric OPNET Modeler® simulations on different execution environments, such as: stand-alone machines; non-managed computer clusters; clusters relying on Distributed Resources Management systems (DRMs); grid and cloud environments; and multi- and many-core architectures.
